# üìä FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python Projects

This repository contains the **five projects** I completed for the [FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/).  

Each project demonstrates data analysis and visualization skills using **Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.
